This is Kay Agyemang.
I've got affinity for fitness and wellness and also abit of knowledge in sales and marketing. Few months ago, I decided to add programming and computing to the few skills in my arsenal. 
I am also very passionate about start-ups and technology, a team player, result oriented, time management and hardworking and always willing to take up new challenges outside my comfort zone to achieve results.
In my previous line of work over the past few years, I've collaborated with organizational teams to develop several annual planning and budget working documents for National and International contractors on different funded projects,
conducted several researches on customer satisfaction surveys using In-house tools and Microsoft applications as well as voluntary works in several religious & charismatic organizations. 
I studied few scopes of contemporary knowledge regarding technology being fundamentals of cybersecurity, blockchain and basics of windows operating systems during my idle and hobby times. 
I am currently studying Data Science with HyperionDev(CoGrammar) and like I said earlier it's a much needed skill to help me achieve my aspirations and dreams.
Becoming a better version of myself has always been my hallmark for greatness!
